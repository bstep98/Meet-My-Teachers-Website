     <h1>Welcome!</h1>
     <p>Sophomore year has begun! I am no longer a freshman, and I am no longer
        living on campus! Getting to campus every morning is a bit of a hassle,
        but it's really worth it when you take classes as fun as I do! This
        semester, I'm currently enrolled in 5 courses. On Mondays, Wednesdays,
        and Fridays I go to Intro to Creative and Writing and Intro to Theatre.
        I also go to Visual Media on those same days, except Fridays. On
        Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to Media and Society and Intro to Acting.
        My schedule definitely has a nice balance between work and fun, and
        that's exactly the way I like it! It's a lot of work, but I am more than
        willing to put in the effort for these classes.Feel free to take a
        deeper look into the specific pages for each of these classes, where I
        go into more depth into the courses themselves and the professors that
        teach them!</p>
