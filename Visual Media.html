     <h1>COMM 2034: Visual Media</h1>
     <h1>The Professor</h1>
       <p>Comm 2034 is instructed by Dr. Carlos Evia, a super fun-loving guy who likes to crack a lot of jokes.
       Dr. Evia has a personality unlike any other I've seen from a Virginia Tech professor, so learning from him is always interesting.
       In this class we need to not only use our communication and writing skills, but our creative skills.
       Having a professor like Dr. Evia, who is skilled in both communication and visually creative media, is incredibly important
       and I think this is reflected in his personality.</p>
     <h1>Education</h1>
       <p>Dr. Evia attended Universidad LaSalle in Mexico City, and he earned his MSC from there.
       After earning his MSC, Dr. Evia went on to attend Texas Tech University to earn his PHD.</p>
     <h1>Interests</h1>
       <p>Dr. Evia has expressed many of his interests over the course of these past few months. Beyond his skills with Visual Media,
       Dr. Evia shows expertise with a wide variety of other subjects. He works a lot with Technical Communication, this includes User Documentation,
       Structured Authoring, Workplace Safety, and he has even done research concerning Hispanic Construction Workers. Dr. Evia is a member of the
       Society for Technical Communication, and the Darwin Information Typing Architecture Technical Committee. On top of all of this, Dr. Evia also
       received the Outstanding Faculty Outreach award in May 2011, from the Virginia Tech College of Liberal Arts. Dr. Evia also has a very good eye
       for photography and video composition, as he has shown us in class. He also tends to talk a lot about his daughter, as many parents due, and never
       fails to show us pictures and videos of her when he can. He's also made it very clear that he now watches a very large amount of Disney Princess
       movies because of his daughter. I've also overheard that he is very fond of both monkeys and chicken recipes.</p>
     <h1>Research</h1>
       <p>Dr. Evia participates in a large number of University-sponsored research opportunities. With Virginia Tech being a research-based school, this
       is very common among professors. What is not common, however, is the size and scope of the research that Dr. Evia is involved with.
       In 2009-2012 Dr. Evia was named a Co-Principal Investigator for the project "Microprocesses of Latino Construction Workers' Health: Feasibility
       of Computer Assisted Telephone Survey". This project set out to analyze the elevated risk of occupational injury and fatality faced by Latino
       construction workers. Evia and company were granted $250,000 for research, and worked in tandem with the National Institute of Occupational Safety
       and Health.</p>
     <h1>Class Description</h1>
       <p>The focus of Comm 2034 is to give students experience in communication over forms other than text or spoken word. This includes many non-verbal
       forms of communication. To ease us into this shift in communication, our first module focused on page layout, so that we were still working with
       words, but the visual aspect of those words needed to be taken into account. This module culminated in the creation of a hypothetical magazine,
       with the cover and one article from the magazine being made. Our second module focused more on non-verbal communication, this took the form of
       photographic composition, with each of us learning basic compositional skills, as well as photo-editing skills. The project for this module has us
       take pictures all over Blacksburg that encapsulated the theme "Fall in Blacksburg". Our third module focused on basic videography and script-writing.
       The project for this module was a short video that was to be fully scripted, shot, and edited by us. Our final module focused on web presence and how
       to create our own websites. This culminated with the creation of an online portfolio that shows the work of each student in the class.</p>
       <p>Beyond working with these aspects of visual media and non-verbal communication, Dr. Evia also has us complete our work in groups, allowing us to
       strengthen our collaborative skills and work with one another to create a product that we might have otherwise not been able to make on our own.</p>
      <h1>My Opinion</h1>
      <p>I personally love this class! Dr. Evia makes this work very fun! He merges creativity into our work, and it really sets the course apart from
        other COMM courses here at Tech. This lends itself to our work being very subjective, and Dr. Evia treats it as such. Overall, this class is an
        incredibly fun time and I enjoy the time I get to spend in it!</p>
