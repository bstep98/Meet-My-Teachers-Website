     <h1>TA 2024: Intro to Acting</h1>
     <h1>The Professor</h1>
       <p>TA 2024 is taught by Brittney Harris. Brittney is a super energetic, fun woman, and she is incredibly
       knowledgeable about the art of acting. Brittney strives to make the class a fun expereince for everyone in it,
       and she succeeds every single time we meet. The energy she brings to class is unlike any professor I've ever had.
       Brittney also makes it very clear that she cares for each and every one of her students, and wants to see us succeed.</p>
     <h1>Education</h1>
       <p>Brittney received her Bachelor's of Fine Arts from Old Dominion University. She then went on to attend the University
       of Georgia for her Master's of Fine Arts. She is currently at Virginia Tech for a two year post-MFA fellowship.</p>
     <h1>Interests</h1>
       <p>Brittney is incredibly interested in the art of acting, but beyond that she has worked with cultural enrichment and diversity/inclusion.
       She specializes in performance and outreach and the creation of an open forum in which individuals are free from racial and gender
       based limitation. Brittney also loves to talk about her dog, and even once offered to bring it to class, but that has yet to happen.
       We've also had lengthy talks about superhero movies and Pokemon, so Brittney's interests really line up a lot with my own!</p>
     <h1>Research</h1>
       <p>Brittney has conductied a number of workshops in both Solo Performance Development and Race and Performance within the Southeast Theatre
          conference region, which inclues KCACTF Region IV, the Georgia Theatre Conference (GTA) and the Virginia Theatre Association Conference (VTA).
          I am also currently working alongside Brittney and some of my other classmates to create a piece of non-scripted theatre that showcases
          reasearch conducted by Dr. Madeline Flint, which deals with the construction of domestic structures, and how a lack of money, time, and quality
          materials leads to structures that are unsafe, yet still being sold to the public. Our job is to visualize Dr. Flint's work in whatever way we can
          so that the audience has a better understanding of the danger presented by unsafe domestic structures.</p>
     <h1>Class Description</h1>
       <p>The purpose of TA 2024 is to provide a foundation for all actors of any skill level to build upon as they expand further into the craft.
          This includes basic principles like projection, stage presence, diction, the parts of the stage, and basic terminology. But we also explore
          audition basics, characterization, the state of the acting industry in both theatre and film, and how to deliver an effective monologue. Overall,
          actors at any point in their career can benefit from the things taught in TA 2024 because of strong foundation it provides.</p>
      <h1>My Opinion</h1>
      <p>I enjoy Intro to Acting a lot! It's a class where I personally consider not only all of my classmates, but my professor one of my friends! Brittney
         has created a very fun environment in the class, and as long as we're honest about how we're feeling and how much work we are putting in, there is no way to
         do poorly in this class! I enjoy going to this class twice every week, and I'm glad Brittney is my professor.</p>
