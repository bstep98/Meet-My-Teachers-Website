     <h1>ENGL 2744: Intro to Creative Writing</h1>
     <h1>The Professor</h1>
       <p>ENGL 2744 is taught by Robin Allnutt, an incredibly passionate and knowledgeable man. Robin is an incredibly skilled
          writer, and he never ceases to provide incredible insight into how to make a work of creative writing not only entertaining,
          but compelling for the reader. He also is very knowledgeable about structural concepts in writing that make your work much more pleasing
          for the reader to take in. Robin is incredibly skilled, and I enjoy the creative outlet his class provides.</p>
     <h1>Education</h1>
       <p>Robin received his Bachelor's degree in the Arts from Virginia Tech. He then went on to receive his Master's of Fine Arts and Creative Writing,
          with a focus on fictional writing, from George Mason University.</p>
     <h1>Interests</h1>
       <p>Robin very much enjoys works of fiction that are very well put together and well-written. He has often gone on tangents in class where he tells us
          to look into specific writers or pieces that he has read previously. He is clearly very interested and passionate about his craft, and it seems that
          it takes up a large amount of his focus even when he isn't working. Robin also has an affinity for theatre, and has told me about many productions that
          he has seen both on and off Broadway. Overall, Robin is very interested in all forms of literature, and this is most likely what attributes to his large
          amount of skill and finesse when it comes to writing.</p>
     <h1>Research</h1>
       <p>I was unable to find any Unitversity-sponsored research that Robin has participated in, but I was able to find an article recounting Robin's experience
          after the April 2007 shooting at Virginia Tech. Robin wrote this piece in April of 2017, ten years after the shooting, for Guernica magazine. Though this
          piece was written ten years after the shooting, it recounts how Robin felt the day after the shooting. The piece is incredibly well done, and Robin
          exemplifies his ability to create a piece that audiences can empathize with. He really captures the feelings of not only loss, but numbness that must have followed him after the
          April 2007 tragedy. Robin is an amazingly skilled writer, and this piece only shows that.</p>
     <h1>Class Description</h1>
       <p>The purpose of ENGL 2744 is to help new writers learn the basics of prose poetry and verse writing. This takes the form of both fictional and non-fictional
          work. In this course we learn about how to structure our work in such a way that it is compelling to read, and easy for the audience to follow. We also explore
          the basics of characterization, and how to build a scene in a location that is entertaining for the audience. This class is mostly collaborative, with the students
          reading each other's work, and critiquing it based on what Robin has taught us.</p>
      <h1>My Opinion</h1>
      <p>Despite the demanding work flow, I really enjoy Robin's class! I think writing is a creative skill that I inherently possess, but have neglected up until this point.
         I think the things that Robin is teaching us will help us all become better, more compelling writers. He, more than anything else, teaches us what an audience wants to
         read. This is incredibly important to me, because I want to be an entertainer for the rest of my life, so honing in on what an audience wants, and how to best give them
         what they want, is a very significant skill to have.</p>
