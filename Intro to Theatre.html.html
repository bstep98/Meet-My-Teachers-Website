     <h1>TA 2014: Intro to Theatre</h1>
     <h1>The Professor</h1>
       <p>TA 2014 is taught by Susanna Rinehart, the Faculty Chair of Theatre and Cinema at Virginia Tech. Susanna is an very outgoing and passionate woman!
          every class I have with her is always packed with energy, and she is able to present information that we need to know in a way that is fun for us to
          learn! Susanna is clearly passionate bout her work, and I am incredibly happy to be learning from her!</p>
     <h1>Education</h1>
       <p>Susanna received her Bachelor's degree in the Arts from the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, and then went on to receive her Master's degree in Fine Arts
          from the same university.</p>
     <h1>Interests</h1>
       <p>Susanna is incredibly interested in both Shakespean, and contemporary theatre, the latter seemingly moreso than the former. Susanna also stays very up to date in the
          world of politics, and encourages her students to do the same. Overall, she is very interested in teaching, and she enjoys making connections with her students and
          helping them when they need it. Beyond teaching, Susanna has also made it known that she is not only an avid sports fan, but a loud one at that.</p>
     <h1>Research</h1>
       <p>Susanna mainly focuses on producing theatre here at Tech. Every year she either directs or acts in a play, and she claims that not a year has gone by in her life
          where she hasn't made theatre, since she was four years old. She also conducts research for documentary theatre, which culminates with the production of a documentary
          piece, which showcases her reasearch in the form of a narrative. Last year, Susanna directed Tech's production of <i>Distracted</i>, and this year she is going to
          direct Tech's production of <i>The Foreigner</i>.</p>
     <h1>Class Description</h1>
       <p>The purpose of TA 2014 is to expose students to works of theatre that exemplify the creative eras the art has gone through. This includes classical Shakespearean,
          realistic, modernist, post-modernist, contemporary, etc. Students are required to purchase ten plays for the class, and read them as Susanna goes more in-depth into
          the themes and messages explored in the play. We also learn basic theatrical terminology and are required to see two mainstage productions put on by the School of Perfomring
          Arts. This semester, those two mainstage productions were <i>Decision Height</i> and <i>Angels in America Part One: Millennium Approaches</i>.</p>
      <h1>My Opinion</h1>
      <p>I think this class is very important for anyone who wishes to create theatre in any facet. Knowing about the classics, and the times in which they were written is very important.
         Knowing why a play was successful and what themes that play explores is very important to anyone who wishes to make theatre in any form. Being knowledgeable about the basics of
         theatre and every form that theatre can take is no easy task, but Susanna presents the information in a way that sets us up to participate in theatre in any form.</p>
