     <h1>COMM 2084: Media and Society</h1>
     <h1>The Professor</h1>
       <p>COMM 2084 is taught by Jennifer "Jenn" Mackay. Professor Mackay is a very kindhearted and personable professor, a lot of
          her lectures have to do with pop culture, because that's what's currently dominating the media. So, it's her job to be
          up-to-date on pop culture, and she uses that to her advantage in class. Professor Mackay is a lot of fun as a professor,
          she makes sure we're all engaged and having fun while we learn.</p>
     <h1>Education</h1>
       <p>Professor Mackay received a Bachelor's in Journalism in 1998, she then went on to receive her Master's in the Arts from the University
          of Alabama in 2004. She finished her education by receiving her Ph.D from the University of Alabama in 2008.</p>
     <h1>Interests</h1>
       <p>Media and Society deals a lot with pop culture, and how certain Media find their way to, and affect, society. We study the history of the Media,
          and because of this, Professor Mackay has been able to, on multiple occasions, give her opinions about what her interests are. She's expressed an
          interest in superheroes on multiple occasions, with her favorite being Wonder Woman. She also has a great interest in movies, having held a long talk
          about the top selling movies of all time when we studied them earlier this semester. Professor Mackay also keeps a close eye on politics, encouraging
          us to keep a close eye on the Kavanaugh hearings when they were taking place. This even led to the Kavanaugh hearings being on our exam for that unit.
          This interest in politics can be attributed to professor Mackay's interest in journalism, which she has stated has been her career goal since she was young.</p>
     <h1>Research</h1>
       <p>Professor Mackay has contributed to a large amount of studies in her time as a professor. In June 2006 she participated in a study of newspaper preparedness for
          public health emergencies, in which her team analyzed the diffusal of information from newspapers when a new disease infects a population. In July 2008 she participated
          in a study of community journalism, in which the impacts of location and shared meaning were looked at in regard to local journalism. In April 2008 she also participated
          in a study of journalists' reliance on children, and what ethical questions that raises regarding privacy and accuracy.</p>
     <h1>Class Description</h1>
       <p>Media and Society is the study of the history of media, starting with the newspaper, going through the era of T.V., and into the modern era of the internet. We look at major
          happenings and key players in the media. Inventors, artists, journalists, historical events, everything that affects the media. We then extrapolate and look at how that change
          in media affected the society of the time.</p>
      <h1>My Opinion</h1>
      <p>I find Media and Society incredibly interesting. Looking into times that I wasn't alive for and how the media changed, and continues to change is very fascinating, and I like the
         energy professor Mackay puts into it. The course is very tough, with a lot of facts needing to be learned in a short amount of time, but it still stands that the information itself
         is very interesting, and worth the workload.</p>
